Welcome.
In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.
a being 1, b being 2, etc.
As an example:
```python
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
```
Should return ``` "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"``` (As a string.)
